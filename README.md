#brainpicker
====
A set of questions to facilitate design self-critique.

[Visit the website](https://axelvaldez.github.io/brainpicker).

The site is designed to be used in a mobile phone, so the design is completely fluid. If you use it in a big screen, I advise you to resize down your browser window.

To view the code, switch to the gh-pages branch.
